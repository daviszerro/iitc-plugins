Collection of third party IITC plugins not including in [official IITC site](https://iitc.me) which I think handy to use and made some modifications to some of them.

## [Ingress-IITC-Multi-Export](https://github.com/modkin/Ingress-IITC-Multi-Export)

> At the moment we support export of all portals in the current view, bookmarked portals by folders and portals inside a polygon
> 
> As formats we currently got: GPX, CSV and export for Maxfield

## [Force Zoom Level](https://github.com/TheSned/IITCPlugins)

> Forces the display of All Portals or All Links regardless of zoom level. Select the forced zoom level you want in the "Force Zoom Opt" dialog. Warning: This can cause many requests to the server at high zoom levels.
